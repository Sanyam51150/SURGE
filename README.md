# SURGE

In this repository, I will add my research work that I did under Prof. Subrahmanya Swamy Peruru (EE Deaprtment). Domain of my work include machine learning, reinforcement learning and probability. I mainly work on MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) which is fast adaptive deep learning technique for deep networks. I implement it on multi-armed bandit which refers to a probabilistic optimization problem characterized by a set of competing choices with unknown reward distributions, where an agent seeks to intelligently allocate resources over time to maximize cumulative reward while balancing exploration and exploitation. I also wrote a report comparing different methods use to optimise multi-armed bandit, report mainly tells how MAML can be used to outperform many of known techniques as MAML adapt to new environment in less number of trials.
